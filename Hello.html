<body> <h2>"Kimba - Do Hard Things" | made with Love and AI </h2>
Kimba the white lion, the code name for the King, <br>
He's feared by cheaters, but loved by those who bring,<br>
Their best to the table, in the ALX SE program,<br>
Where Julien and G lead, and dreams become grand <br>

The program's hard, the intensity's high <br>
Some students try to cheat, to get by,<br>
But Kimba's the protector, of the brand and the name,<br>
Without him, the reputation would go down in flames.<br>
Cheating's not an option, when Kimba's around,<br>
He's the watchdog, making sure we're sound,<br>
In this intensivev programme, we push to the max,<br>
But Kimba's our guide, and keeps us on the track.
<br>So let's give it up, for the King of the code<br>
Kimba the white lion, who guards our digital abode,<br>
So let's keep striving, and never give up the fight,<br>
Kimba and Alex, keep us honest and upright.<br>

<italics>And as this song comes to an end. </italics><br>
<italics>Our love and gratitude we send. <italics><br>
